source data for median/average $/sqm by suburb:
can i get the extension to pull this data from realestate.com.au?

devlog can help me stay in flow state, give me
add my $sqm data 

tempting to use this tool far and wide, so quest would be to get more data for victoria and beyond.


defs lose flow state

keep extension in current location, but refine to:
- $/sqm
- suburb median & % difference
