source data for median/average $/sqm by suburb:
can i get the extension to pull this data from realestate.com.au?

devlog can help me stay in flow state, give me
add my $sqm data 

tempting to use this tool far and wide, so quest would be to get more data for victoria and beyond.


defs lose flow state

keep extension in current location, but refine to:
- $/sqm
- suburb median & % difference


next get data and tidy UI!. ship by midday.
also get it to load quicker

ship site and extension to show Pat & Z.

update portfoio site?


put on the chrome store! why not, great chance to put something out there and get the experience, share with friends
atleast 1 friend could buy it and that'd be my first $ doing web dev!
consider scraping data from recent and current sales listings for block size medians

adjust for acres, hectares, estimated prices etc

- prepare zip file for upload to chrome store!
- price calc correct

reckon i can get this zip file out and uploaded before midday. that'd be an achievement.

what was the change that effected this?

Melbourne $/sqm
REA Price/SQM
Melbourne Land Valuator

make the branding consistent:
so change the price map to 'Melbourne Land Valuator'
change favicon to match
change site name.
then link it on the extension page
